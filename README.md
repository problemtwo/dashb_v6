# DashB version 0.6: BashD

DashB is a project that I worked on at Khan Lab School in the gorgeous Mountain View, California.
If you want to view the source for this project, look at:
 - index.html
 - style.css
 - main.js

To test it yourself, visit https://the-inhuman-account.github.io/dashb_v6, or run these commands in a terminal:

## MacOS
```bash
 open index.html
```

## Linux
```bash
 xdg-open index.html
```

Enjoy!
